## Challenges we ran into 🐬
As we are new to the Google cloud console and APIs, to overcome the knowledge gap and come up with a functional app was the major challenge of this hackathon.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🍃
Despite the challenges faced while making the app, the final outcome was rewarding as we learnt a lot during the process and are proud to see our idea executed. 
## What we learned 🚢
This hackathon provided us with the opportunity to discover the various Google Maps APIs and map customisation. This served as the foundation of evolving ideas for projects we aim to go through in the near future.
## What's next for Oshen 🌏
In the future we aim that Oshen will provide greater insight into water bodies across the globe by providing statistics, sourced from highly accurate data reserves as well as our own AI models. Users can also contribute to Oshen by interactive features like, sharing and verifying facts about a particular water body via pictures, short questionnaires, etc. and exploring fellow contributors’ reviews. The main focus of our app will be to highlight pollution statistics of water bodies to create awareness on the world's most important natural resource. We also aim to expand our vision into the touristic domain where we can potentially build revenue models for higher research and development of Oshen.
## Thank You 🐠
